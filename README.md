    FizzBuzz is a function which is iterating x in an for loop 100 times. If the number x is divisible by 3 the function will print out the word Fizz.
    If the number x is divisible by 5 the function will print out the word Buzz. If the number x is divisible by 3 and 5 the function will print out the word FizzBuzz.
    IF neither are returning true x will be printed out.
